# Execute

Flexible execution skill with three modes plus a parallel multi-pane launcher. All modes share the same execution engine — the only difference is how tasks are sourced and what the compliance reviewer checks against.

## AFK vs HITL handling (shared)

If the source task is labeled **AFK** (e.g. issue carries the `afk` label, or the spec/conversation marks it AFK), proceed end-to-end through the execution loop without pausing for confirmation between phases — that's what AFK means. If labeled **HITL**, the implementer pauses at each decision point and asks via AskUserQuestion before proceeding. Default when unlabeled: behave as HITL — only escalate to AFK behavior when explicitly marked or when the user is running under `/guardian mode autonomous`.

## Domain awareness (shared, runs before any mode)

If the repo has a `CONTEXT.md` (or a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-module `CONTEXT.md` files), read it. **Use its vocabulary verbatim** in commit messages, test names, function/variable names, PR descriptions, and any user-facing text. The glossary is the project's source of truth for naming — drift defeats the point.

If `docs/adr/` (or `<context>/docs/adr/`) exists and contains ADRs touching the area you're modifying, read them. Do not implement changes that contradict an accepted ADR without first surfacing the conflict to the user.

Pass any relevant `CONTEXT.md` excerpts and ADR references into the implementer-agent prompt as part of `COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE` so the agent uses the same vocabulary.

```
/execute                              → RAW mode   (execute from conversation context)
/execute spec <slug>                  → SPEC mode  (execute from .claude/specs/<slug>/)
/execute issue <number>               → ISSUE mode (execute from GitHub issue)
/execute --multi issue:1,2,3          → MULTI mode (one tmux pane per issue)
/execute --multi spec:foo,bar         → MULTI mode (one tmux pane per spec)
```

---

## Step 0: Mode Selection

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--multi`:** Jump to **Step 0M** (Multi Mode).

Otherwise, parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Empty → **RAW** mode
- Starts with `spec` → **SPEC** mode (extract slug from remaining args, e.g., `/execute spec auth-flow` → slug = `auth-flow`)
- Starts with `issue` → **ISSUE** mode (extract number from remaining args, e.g., `/execute issue 42` → number = `42`)
- Any other non-empty value → **STOP** and tell the user: "Unknown mode. Use `/execute`, `/execute spec <slug>`, `/execute issue <number>`, or `/execute --multi issue:<n>,<n>,...`."

---

## Step 0M: Multi Mode

`--multi` means "new tmux pane, clean context" — each issue or spec gets its own Claude Code instance executing independently.

1. Parse the argument after `--multi`. It must be one of:
   - `issue:<n>,<n>,...` — comma-separated issue numbers
   - `spec:<slug>,<slug>,...` — comma-separated spec slugs

   If neither form matches (or no identifiers follow), STOP and tell the user: "`--multi` requires `issue:<numbers>` or `spec:<slugs>`. Raw prompts are not supported."

2. Verify tmux is available and we're inside a tmux session:
   ```bash
   tmux display-message -p '#S:#I' 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If this fails, STOP and tell the user: "`--multi` requires an active tmux session. Start tmux first, then re-run."

3. Capture the current session and window (e.g. `mysession:0`).

4. For each identifier in the comma-separated list, create a new tmux pane and launch a Claude Code instance:

   ```bash
   # For ISSUE mode — each issue gets its own pane:
   tmux split-window -t "$SESSION:$WINDOW" -h \
     "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print 'Run /execute issue <NUMBER>. Implement the issue fully — derive tasks, execute, commit, and report when done.' 2>&1; echo '--- Execution of issue #<NUMBER> complete. Press Enter to close. ---'; read"
   tmux select-layout -t "$SESSION:$WINDOW" tiled

   # For SPEC mode — each spec gets its own pane:
   tmux split-window -t "$SESSION:$WINDOW" -h \
     "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print 'Run /execute spec <SLUG>. Execute the spec fully — work through all tasks, commit, and report when done.' 2>&1; echo '--- Execution of spec <SLUG> complete. Press Enter to close. ---'; read"
   tmux select-layout -t "$SESSION:$WINDOW" tiled
   ```

5. Output:
   ```text
   Multi execution launched:
     Mode: [issue | spec]
     Items: #1, #2, #3  (or foo, bar, baz)
     Panes: N new tmux panes created
     Each instance executes independently with full review cycles.

   Watch progress in the tmux panes. This instance is done.
   ```

6. **STOP.** Do not proceed to Step 1 — the tmux instances handle the execution.

## Step 1: Task Sourcing (mode-specific)

### RAW Mode

1. Summarize what the user wants from conversation context into a concrete task list.
2. Explore the codebase to understand relevant files, patterns, and conventions.
3. Break the work into discrete, ordered tasks (same format as `tasks.md`).
4. Present via AskUserQuestion:

> Here's what I understand you want to implement:
> - Task 1: [description]
> - Task 2: [description]
> - Task 3: [description]
>
> **COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE** (what I'll check the implementation against):
> "[2-3 sentence summary of intent]"
>
> A) Proceed  B) Let me clarify

Store the confirmed summary as `COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE`.

### SPEC Mode

1. Find the spec using the slug parsed in Step 0 (e.g., `auth-flow` → `.claude/specs/auth-flow/`). If no slug was provided after `spec`, use the most recent spec in `.claude/specs/`. Read all spec files:
   - `requirements.md`
   - `design.md`
   - `tasks.md`
   - `diagrams.md` (if exists — generated by `/plan visualize`)

2. **If `tasks.md` doesn't exist or has no tasks:** Stop. "No tasks found. Run `/plan review` first to generate tasks."

3. Store `requirements.md` + `design.md` content as `COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE`.

### ISSUE Mode

1. Fetch the issue:
```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,comments,assignees
```

2. Parse the issue body:
   - If it contains checklists (`- [ ]` items), extract them as tasks directly.
   - If prose only, derive discrete tasks (same approach as RAW mode).

3. Present via AskUserQuestion:

> Issue #N: **<title>**
> Tasks derived from the issue:
> - Task 1: [description]
> - Task 2: [description]
>
> A) Proceed  B) Let me clarify

4. Store issue title + body + comments as `COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE`.

---

## Step 2: Pre-flight + Branch (shared)

1. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
2. Review the task list critically — are tasks ordered correctly? Are dependencies satisfied?
3. Check the current branch. If on `main`/`master`, create a feature branch:
   - **SPEC:** `feat/<slug>`
   - **ISSUE:** `feat/<issue-number>-<slugified-title>` (max 50 chars)
   - **RAW:** Ask user or derive from first task description
4. Raise any concerns via AskUserQuestion before starting.

---

## Step 3: Execution Loop (shared)

Execute tasks sequentially, reporting progress in batches of 3. For each task:

### 3a: Dispatch implementer agent

```text
prompt: "You are implementing a task. Read CLAUDE.md first.

TASK:
<full task text — never make the agent read a file>

CONTEXT:
<COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE content — spec sections, issue body, or user summary>

DIAGRAMS:
<relevant diagrams from diagrams.md, if they exist (SPEC mode only)>

Instructions:
1. If anything is unclear, list your questions and STOP — do not guess.
2. Implement exactly what the task specifies. Nothing more, nothing less.
3. Write tests for new functionality.
4. Run tests to verify they pass.
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
   ISSUE mode: include 'Refs #<number>' in commit message.
6. Self-review: check completeness, code quality, test coverage.

Return: what you implemented, what tests you wrote, test results, any concerns."
description: "Implement task: <task title>"
```

**If the agent has questions:** Present them to the user via AskUserQuestion. Answer, then re-dispatch.

### 3b: Dispatch compliance reviewer

After the implementer finishes:

```text
prompt: "You are reviewing an implementation for compliance. Read the actual code changes (git diff), not just the implementer's report.

TASK THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED:
<full task text>

COMPLIANCE REFERENCE:
<COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE — spec requirements, issue body, or user summary>

Check:
- Did the implementer build exactly what was requested?
- Is anything missing from the requirements?
- Is there extra/unneeded work beyond the task scope?
- Do the tests cover the requirements?

Report: ✅ Passes compliance, or ❌ with specific file:line issues."
description: "Compliance review: <task title>"
```

**If issues found:** Re-dispatch the implementer with the specific issues. Re-review after fixes. Max 2 fix cycles — if still failing, escalate to user.

### 3c: Dispatch code quality reviewer

Only after compliance passes:

```text
prompt: "You are reviewing code quality. Read CLAUDE.md first, then review the changes.

Run: git diff origin/main --name-only to find changed files. Read each changed file.

Check:
- Does the code follow project conventions from CLAUDE.md?
- Are there DRY violations, unnecessary complexity, or missing error handling?
- Could existing utilities be reused instead of new code?
- Are there security concerns?

Report: list of issues (Critical/Important/Minor) with file:line references and suggested fixes."
description: "Quality review: <task title>"
```

**If critical issues found:** Fix them (or dispatch implementer to fix). Re-review.

### 3d: Simplify

After quality review passes, run `/simplify` to clean up the changed code — reuse opportunities, clarity, consistency. This ensures the final code is polished before marking the task complete.

### 3e: Mark task complete

- **SPEC mode:** Update `tasks.md` — check off the completed task.
- **ISSUE/RAW mode:** Track completion internally (no tasks.md to update).

---

## Step 4: Batch Checkpoint (shared)

After each batch of 3 tasks, report to the user:

```text
Batch N complete: tasks X-Y done
  Implemented: [summary of each task]
  Compliance reviews: all passed (or N fix cycles needed)
  Quality reviews: N issues found and fixed
  Tests: all passing

Next batch: tasks Y+1 to Z
Continue? (A) Yes  (B) Review changes first  (C) Stop here
```

---

## Step 5: Completion (shared, with mode-specific updates)

After all tasks are done:

1. Run the full test suite.
2. Mode-specific updates:
   - **SPEC:** Update `tasks.md` with all checkboxes checked. If `CHANGELOG.md` exists, update it; otherwise skip.
   - **ISSUE:** Comment on the issue:
     ```bash
     gh issue comment <number> --body "Implementation complete on branch \`$(git branch --show-current)\`. Changes: <summary of files changed and tests written>"
     ```
     Ask user: "Close this issue? (A) Yes (B) No, keep open until PR merges"
   - **RAW:** No external updates.
3. Report final status:

```text
Execution complete:
  Mode: <RAW|SPEC|ISSUE>
  Tasks: N/N completed
  Test suite: passing
  Fix cycles: N total across all tasks

Ready for /review and /ship
```

---

## Step 6: Optional PR (shared)

If creating a PR directly (instead of handing off to `/ship`):

1. Read the PR body template at `.claude/skills/ship/pr-template.md`
2. Follow the template structure: Summary, How It Works, Important Files, Test Results, Pre-Landing Review, Doc Completeness
3. **ISSUE mode:** Add `Closes #<number>` to the PR body
4. Create the PR using `gh pr create` with the formatted body
5. Output the PR URL

---

## Gotchas

- **Never start implementing on main/master.** Always create a feature branch first.
- **The compliance reviewer checks against `COMPLIANCE_REFERENCE`** — this is spec docs in SPEC mode, issue body in ISSUE mode, or user-confirmed summary in RAW mode. Same reviewer, different reference material.
- **Compliance review BEFORE quality review.** No point polishing code that doesn't match the requirements.
- **Include full task text in agent prompts.** Never tell the agent to "read tasks.md" — fresh agents don't have your context.
- **Max 2 fix cycles per review stage.** If it's still failing after 2 rounds, the task spec is probably unclear — escalate to the user.
- **Tasks must execute sequentially within a single pane.** Unlike parallel review agents, implementation tasks often have dependencies. Never dispatch multiple implementers in parallel inside one execution. (For independent issues/specs, use `--multi` to split across panes instead.)
- **Issue mode requires `gh` CLI.** If `gh` is not installed or not authenticated, abort with instructions.
- **Never auto-close issues.** Always ask the user first.
- **RAW mode depends on conversation context.** If the conversation has no clear task, ask the user to describe what they want.
- **Issue checklist parsing:** If the issue body has `- [ ]` items, use them as tasks directly. If prose only, derive tasks like RAW mode.
- **`--multi` only works with `issue:` and `spec:`** — raw prompts have no identifier to split on. If the user passes `--multi` without an `issue:` or `spec:` list, abort and ask them to specify identifiers.
- **`--multi` requires an active tmux session.** It uses `tmux split-window` to spawn panes — outside tmux there's nowhere to put them. Check `tmux display-message` before spawning.
