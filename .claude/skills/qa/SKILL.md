# /qa: Systematic QA Testing

You are a QA engineer. Test web applications like a real user — click everything, fill every form, check every state. Produce a structured report with evidence.

## Setup

**Parse the user's request for these parameters:**

| Parameter | Default | Override example |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Target URL | (auto-detect or required) | `https://myapp.com`, `http://localhost:3000` |
| Mode | full | `--quick`, `--regression .context/qa-reports/baseline.json` |
| Output dir | `.context/qa-reports/` | `Output to /tmp/qa` |
| Scope | Full app (or diff-scoped) | `Focus on the billing page` |
| Auth | None | `Sign in to user@example.com`, `Import cookies from cookies.json` |

**If no URL is given and you're on a feature branch:** Automatically enter **diff-aware mode** (see Modes below).

**Verify browser automation is available:**

```bash
which agent-browser 2>/dev/null && echo "READY" || echo "NEEDS_INSTALL"
```

If `NEEDS_INSTALL`, tell the user: "agent-browser is needed for QA testing. Install with: `npm install -g agent-browser && agent-browser install`". Then STOP and wait.

**Create output directories:**

```bash
REPORT_DIR=".context/qa-reports"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots"
```

## Browser Commands

All browser interaction uses `agent-browser`. Key commands:

```bash
agent-browser open <url>                    # Start session, open URL
agent-browser snapshot                      # Get accessibility tree with @ref IDs
agent-browser screenshot <path>             # Save screenshot
agent-browser click @<ref>                  # Click element
agent-browser fill @<ref> "<value>"         # Type into input
agent-browser select @<ref> "<value>"       # Select dropdown option
agent-browser hover @<ref>                  # Hover element
agent-browser scroll <direction>            # Scroll up/down/left/right
agent-browser find "<text>"                 # Search visible text
agent-browser wait <ms>                     # Wait for duration
agent-browser close                         # Close session
```

Use `--session qa` flag on all commands to isolate the QA session.

## Modes

### Diff-aware (automatic when on a feature branch with no URL)

This is the **primary mode** for developers verifying their work.

1. **Analyze the branch diff** to understand what changed:
   ```bash
   git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only
   git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Identify affected pages/routes** from the changed files:
   - Controller/route files -> which URL paths they serve
   - View/template/component files -> which pages render them
   - Model/service files -> which pages use those models
   - API endpoints -> test them directly
   - Static pages -> navigate to them directly

3. **Detect the running app** — check common local dev ports:
   ```bash
   agent-browser --session qa open http://localhost:3000 2>/dev/null && echo "Found :3000" || \
   agent-browser --session qa open http://localhost:4000 2>/dev/null && echo "Found :4000" || \
   agent-browser --session qa open http://localhost:8080 2>/dev/null && echo "Found :8080"
   ```
   If nothing works, ask the user for the URL.

4. **Test each affected page/route:**
   - Navigate to the page
   - Take a screenshot
   - Check for errors via snapshot
   - If the change was interactive, test the interaction end-to-end

5. **Cross-reference with commit messages and PR description** to understand intent — what should the change do? Verify it actually does that.

6. **Check TODO.md** (if it exists) for known bugs related to the changed files.

7. **Report findings** scoped to the branch changes.

### Full (default when URL is provided)
Systematic exploration. Visit every reachable page. Document 5-10 well-evidenced issues. Produce health score. Takes 5-15 minutes depending on app size.

### Quick (`--quick`)
30-second smoke test. Visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets. Check: page loads? Console errors? Broken links visible? Produce health score.

### Regression (`--regression <baseline>`)
Run full mode, then load `baseline.json` from a previous run. Diff: which issues are fixed? Which are new? What's the score delta?

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initialize

1. Verify `agent-browser` is available
2. Create output directories
3. Copy report template from `.claude/skills/qa/templates/qa-report-template.md` to output dir
4. Start timer for duration tracking

### Phase 2: Authenticate (if needed)

**If the user specified auth credentials:**

```bash
agent-browser --session qa open <login-url>
agent-browser --session qa snapshot              # Find the login form
agent-browser --session qa fill @<email> "user@example.com"
agent-browser --session qa fill @<pass> "[REDACTED]"
agent-browser --session qa click @<submit>
agent-browser --session qa wait 2000
agent-browser --session qa snapshot              # Verify login succeeded
```

**If the user provided a cookie file (JSON format with name/value/domain):**
Import cookies by navigating to the domain first, then setting cookies via JavaScript execution if supported by agent-browser. Otherwise, ask the user to log in manually in the browser.

**If 2FA/OTP is required:** Ask the user for the code and wait.

**If CAPTCHA blocks you:** Tell the user: "Please complete the CAPTCHA in the browser, then tell me to continue."

### Phase 3: Orient

Get a map of the application:

```bash
agent-browser --session qa open <target-url>
agent-browser --session qa snapshot
agent-browser --session qa screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/initial.png"
```

Use the snapshot accessibility tree to discover navigation links and page structure.

**Detect framework** (note in report metadata):
- `__next` in HTML or `_next/data` -> Next.js
- `csrf-token` meta tag -> Rails
- `wp-content` in URLs -> WordPress
- Client-side routing with no page reloads -> SPA

### Phase 4: Explore

Visit pages systematically. At each page:

```bash
agent-browser --session qa open <page-url>
agent-browser --session qa snapshot
agent-browser --session qa screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/page-name.png"
```

Then follow the **per-page exploration checklist** (see `.claude/skills/qa/references/issue-taxonomy.md`):

1. **Visual scan** — Look at the screenshot for layout issues
2. **Interactive elements** — Click buttons, links, controls. Do they work?
3. **Forms** — Fill and submit. Test empty, invalid, edge cases
4. **Navigation** — Check all paths in and out
5. **States** — Empty state, loading, error, overflow
6. **Console** — Check snapshot for error indicators after interactions
7. **Responsiveness** — Check mobile viewport if relevant

**Depth judgment:** Spend more time on core features (homepage, dashboard, checkout, search) and less on secondary pages (about, terms, privacy).

**Quick mode:** Only visit homepage + top 5 navigation targets. Skip the per-page checklist — just check: loads? Visible errors? Broken links?

### Phase 5: Document

Document each issue **immediately when found** — don't batch them.

**Interactive bugs** (broken flows, dead buttons, form failures):
1. Screenshot before the action
2. Perform the action
3. Screenshot showing the result
4. Write repro steps referencing screenshots

```bash
agent-browser --session qa screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-before.png"
agent-browser --session qa click @<ref>
agent-browser --session qa wait 1000
agent-browser --session qa screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/screenshots/issue-001-after.png"
```

**Static bugs** (typos, layout issues, missing images):
1. Take a screenshot showing the problem
2. Describe what's wrong

**Write each issue to the report immediately** using the template format.

### Phase 6: Wrap Up

1. **Compute health score** using the rubric below
2. **Write "Top 3 Things to Fix"** — the 3 highest-severity issues
3. **Update severity counts** in the summary table
4. **Fill in report metadata** — date, duration, pages visited, screenshot count, framework
5. **Close the browser session:** `agent-browser --session qa close`
6. **Save baseline** — write `baseline.json` for future regression runs

**Regression mode:** After writing the report, load the baseline file. Compare health score delta, fixed issues, and new issues. Append regression section.

## Health Score Rubric

Compute each category score (0-100), then take the weighted average.

### Console (weight: 15%)
- 0 errors -> 100
- 1-3 errors -> 70
- 4-10 errors -> 40
- 10+ errors -> 10

### Links (weight: 10%)
- 0 broken -> 100
- Each broken link -> -15 (minimum 0)

### Per-Category Scoring (Visual, Functional, UX, Content, Performance, Accessibility)
Each category starts at 100. Deduct per finding:
- Critical issue -> -25
- High issue -> -15
- Medium issue -> -8
- Low issue -> -3
Minimum 0 per category.

### Weights

| Category | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Console | 15% |
| Links | 10% |
| Visual | 10% |
| Functional | 20% |
| UX | 15% |
| Performance | 10% |
| Content | 5% |
| Accessibility | 15% |

### Final Score
`score = sum(category_score * weight)`

## Important Rules

1. **Repro is everything.** Every issue needs at least one screenshot. No exceptions.
2. **Verify before documenting.** Retry the issue once to confirm it's reproducible, not a fluke.
3. **Never include credentials.** Write `[REDACTED]` for passwords in repro steps.
4. **Write incrementally.** Append each issue to the report as you find it. Don't batch.
5. **Never read source code.** Test as a user, not a developer.
6. **Test like a user.** Use realistic data. Walk through complete workflows end-to-end.
7. **Depth over breadth.** 5-10 well-documented issues with evidence > 20 vague descriptions.
8. **Always close the browser session** when done to avoid leaked processes.

## Output Structure

```text
.context/qa-reports/
├── qa-report-{domain}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md    # Structured report
├── screenshots/
│   ├── initial.png                        # Landing page screenshot
│   ├── issue-001-before.png               # Per-issue evidence
│   ├── issue-001-after.png
│   └── ...
└── baseline.json                          # For regression mode
```

Report filenames use the domain and date: `qa-report-myapp-com-2026-03-15.md`

## Gotchas

- **Use `origin/main` not `main`** in diff-aware mode. Local main may be stale.
- **Slow-load threshold is >3s everywhere.** Flag any page that takes longer than 3 seconds to become interactive.
- **`agent-browser` is required** — there is no fallback. No cookie import support either; if auth requires cookies, the user must log in manually in the browser session.
- **Screenshots are evidence.** Every issue needs at least one. If `agent-browser screenshot` fails, retry once before skipping.
- **Quick mode skips the per-page checklist** — it only checks: loads? Visible errors? Broken links? Don't over-test in quick mode.
